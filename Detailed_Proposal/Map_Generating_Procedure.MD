# Map Generating Procedure

Included in the main directory will be a png of a map of Illinois called "map.png". This is the map we will be using for all data visualization, unless we have additional time, because incorporating varying scales would add a high degree of complexity that might interfere with the main functionalities of the heatmap. 

To generate the visualization of our heatmap, will use a PNG manipulation technique that draws inpsiration from and builds upon previous assignments in this class. We will perform an image traversal of the PNG map we included in the main directory, labeled "map.png". This will be the standard map we will use for all heat maps. Doing so will allow us to use a standardized scale by which we can consitently assign quantified geographical areas to pixels.

To determine the scale of the picture, we will use extreme values of the geographical dimensions of IL and the dimensions of the PNG in pixels to assign a quantative size to the pixel.
