# Week of November 22th - 26th

1) Did mathematical calculations necessary for our findWeight() function. This required the evaluation of a surface integral and factored in the average population distribution of NYC as a reference. After testing manually, we found this mathematic basis a highly accurate representation of the population density at a certain distance away from the city center, specifically Chicago.

2) We also began the fromCSV() function by learning about fstream and how to transform the CSV file into a vector of strings and seperate values based upon the presence of commas and retrieve the data we need from it. The fromCSV function had remaining bugs that needed debugging, including casting issues.
